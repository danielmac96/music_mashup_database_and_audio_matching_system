# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide

current goal: The onboarding flow is built and working. Pasting a SoundCloud link into the
bar at the top of Library auto-processes every track through download → stems → analyze →
structure via a bounded, resumable job queue (see readme "First run"). Phases 1–4 of
`docs/plans/roadmap/execution_plan.md` are done: instant keyboard audition, repaired
timbre/energy, vectorised scoring, phrase-snapped sections, section-level pairs, diversity +
filters, and the UI consolidated to four tabs (Library / Mixes / Discover / Studio) with the
database browser behind ⚙ Settings. Next up is the operational runbook in §5 — importing the
~17 Big Bootie mixes — then T2.4–T2.7 (dataset build, training, mix quality-of-life). Staying
local (FastAPI + Vite + SQLite); no cloud and no multi-song "Big Bootie" set builder yet.

## Project Purpose

Take soundcloud link. Get all info on songs as possible from soundcloud. Download using the current download script.
Improve ingest and download folders where possible.

We want very simple user friendly steps. Ultimately the web app will be used to interact with playlist links to download 
to a specificed local location.
